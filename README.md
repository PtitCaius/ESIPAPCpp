The computing sessions requires to a fully-operational system with all the packages installed and configured. The preparation of your system must be done before the computing sessions: there will be no time during these sessions for installing the missing packages.
Two solutions are proposed for having your system ready:

  - Downloading and using an image of a pre-configured Linux distribution with the help of the program VirtualBox. [Please follow this instructions](doc/install/VirtualBox.md)
